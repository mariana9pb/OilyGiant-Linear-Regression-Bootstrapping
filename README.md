# OilyGiant-Linear-Regression-Bootstrapping
OilyGiant â€“ Oil Field Profit Optimization (Linear Regression &amp; Bootstrapping)


**Developed a model to identify the most profitable region for drilling 200 new oil wells.**

- Trained linear regression models on geological survey data from three regions to predict oil reserves and select top-performing drilling sites.
- Simulated profits based on production estimates, investment constraints, and commodity prices. Used bootstrapping (1,000 iterations) to estimate average profit, confidence intervals, and risk of financial loss.
- Selected the optimal region with <2.5% risk of loss and highest expected return; conducted full model evaluation using RMSE, reserve thresholds, and financial viability analysis. Technologies: Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn.
